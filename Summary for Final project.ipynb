    "# Problem:\n",
    "  One of the most attractive problems of Computer Vision is the OCR(Optical Character Recognition) problem. In this project, we represent one module of the OCR project in domain of Vietnamese handwriting text, which is character recognition. We use the approach of firstly using character detection to split image into many small pictures consisting character, then we use character recognition to read them.  \n",
    "  For the detection module, we use a CRAFT pretrained model in the demo. In our project, we focus mainly on building our own chracter recognition model.\n",
